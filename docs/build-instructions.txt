How to build this code
======================

Graham Stark 19 July 2013

This code is continually under development []

Basic Build

1) You need install an up-to-date version of [Gnat Ada](http://libre.adacore.com/download/)
   the document  2012-complete-install.txt, in this directory, contains my notes on how
   to do this on a Linux system. The 2012 or 2013 editions should both work (notes on
   2013 edition are identical except AUint and Ada XML are bundled and don't need build seperately.
   
2)
