I have recently completed a library of Ada packages that I would like
to submit to both AdaPower and AdaWorld;  I hope one or both of these
repositories will make the product available to the Ada community.

These items are useful to numerical analysis programs that need to do
textual input and output.  They extend Text_IO for floating point
vectors and matrices, facilitate interactive user prompting, simplify
entry of floating numbers, and define a name-directed capability for
all of integers, floats, vectors, matrices, enumerated types and
strings.

This product has been under sporadic development since about 1986 and
is fairly well cooked by now.  It comes with source, documentation,
test programs, and examples of its use to match six different
mathematical libraries that define matrix algebra.

It's all gnat-style gnu licensed.  Its predecessor has been publicly
available since 1993 -- in the PAL and its successors.

If you will provide an accessible location, I'd like to give these
items to my Ada friends.  Can you tell me how to transmit a WinZIP
archive containing the files?

Regards
John
