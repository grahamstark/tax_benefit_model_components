How to build this code
======================

Graham Stark 19 July 2013

This code is continually under development []

Basic Build

1) You need install an up-to-date version of [Gnat Ada](http://libre.adacore.com/download/)
   the document  2012-complete-install.txt, in this directory, contains my notes on how
   to do this on a Linux system. The 2012 or 2013 editions should both work (notes on
   2013 edition are identical except AUint and Ada XML are bundled and don't need build seperately.
   Alternatively, it may be that the GNAT version packaged with Debian Linux (and downstream)
   will work, though this is not tested.
   
2) Set paths for Ada. The set_ada_paths script can be modified for this; it assumes Ada installed
   in 
   
   /opt/ada/[version] 
   
   and libraries in 
   
   /opt/ada_libraries/[version]

   where version is '2012', '2013', etc..

3) Other software:
   various other software is used but may not be needed for an immediate build
   
   libssl
   build-essentials
   mysql
   mysql-development
   unix odbc 
   postgres
   postgres-devel
   ruby
   python
