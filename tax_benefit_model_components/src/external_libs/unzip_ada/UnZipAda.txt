What is UnZip-Ada ?
===================

UnZip-Ada is a decompression library for zipped files,
i.e. files compressed by PKZIP (PKWARE Inc. - http://www.pkware.com/)
or a compatible file compressor like Winzip.
The presently best Zip-Deflate compressors, in terms of
compression ratio, are certainly 7-Zip (http://www.7-zip.org/),
KZip (http://www.advsys.net/ken/utils.htm#kzip) or BJWFlate.
Of course, there are way better compression methods than what the
Deflate format allows, but it is another story.

The full source is in Ada - pure Ada, not even a single dependency
to a compiler, an OS or to an external package or library!
The price for the *absolute* portability of UnZip-Ada hold in two details:
time stamps and attributes of decompressed files are not restored 
as original. That's it!

In addition to UnZip, there is also an UnZip.Streams in order to read
mixed data _directly from a zip file_ as any input stream,
without needing to write a temporary uncompressed file.

For details about the code's history, read the file unzip.ads.


Features
========

 - unconditionally portable (see below a list of in-use platforms)
 - archive can be a file or any other data stream
 - data to be archived or extracted can be a file or any other data stream
 - possibility to read the Zip archive's directory once into a Zip_info
   variable and use it to search quickly and decompress selected archived
   files, or traverse completely the directory to do some specific task
 - UnZip decompresses all Zip methods up to and including Deflate (v. 2.x);
     this includes files made by PKZip, Winzip, Info-Zip's Zip,
     Java's JARs, OpenDocument files, and many others
 - Zip.Create for creating archives and Zip.Compress for compression
     only store & shrink methods so far
 - decryption (v. 2.x)
 - task-safe

Contents
========

* The subdirectory Zip_Lib contains the full source of the UnZip-Ada library
  as well as a more general Zip manipulation library, Zip-Ada.
  All you need for unpacking zip files is there.
  These sources are in Ada 95, so any Ada 95 and above compiler
  will like them.
  I suggest to simply copy this Zip_Lib folder as a sub-folder of your
  project's sources.
  The library's "front-end" packages are:
    - UnZip for uncompressing archives to files
    - UnZip.Streams for uncompressing archive entries to streams
    - Zip for some definitions (e.g. the Zip_Info type)
  The back-end packages are set as private. You don't need (and cannot)
  refer to them, even to care of them...

* In the main directory, you have the following command-line demo
  procedures for testing UnZip-Ada:

  - UnZipAda.adb        : a minimal standalone unzipping tool
  - Comp_Zip.adb        : a small tool for comparing two .zip archives
  - Test_UnZ_Streams.adb: a tiny demo for UnZip.Streams
  - ZipAda.adb          : a minimal standalone zipping tool
                            (only weak compression so far!)
  - ReZip.adb           : a tool for recompressing Zip archives
  - ZipTest.adb         : a test for zip archive creation as a general stream

  These demos can be built as main programs. 
  Some are using Ada 2005's Ada.Directories for directory creation (UnZipAda)
  or reading time stamps (ZipAda). A Ada 95-only compiler will protest and
  you can use custom functions instead of the Ada 2005 ones.

* To build the tests, simply "gnatmake" or "adamake" them !
  You can also start "make_uza" for minimal effort with GNAT.

  There are also the following project files for building them
  with various systems:
  - UnZipAda.gpr for GNAT or the GNAT Programming Studio
  - UnZipAda_A#.sln for Microsoft Visual Studio and A# (uses files
      UnZipAda_A#.adaproj and UnZipAda_Asharp.gpr)
  - UnZipAda_ObjectAda.prj for Aonix's ObjectAda 7.2.2 and later  

* The file extensions of source files are GNAT-ish:
  .ads is specification; .adb is body
  Rename the files if necessary.

* The Zip format specification is as always in a file called appnote.txt.
  You find a copy within the Unzip-Ada pack but might find a fresher
  version here:
  http://www.pkware.com/business_and_developers/developer/appnote/

Other infos are in zip.ads and unzip.ads, specifications of Zip and UnZip
packages.

Finally, here are a list of various historical pkzip executables on my PC.
The names are appended with version number.
I also add the method names.

  50'663   1.03.99   2:50   pkzip250.exe  Deflate

They come from the Web, under the following
names (original shareware packages):

  91'520   4.07.99   8:03   pkz090.zip
 102'499   4.07.99   8:03   pkz092.zip

  60'695   9.11.00  16:18   pkz193a.zip

Do a "ftpsearch" to find them - or contact me...

Latest changes
==============

* Changes in '26', 30-Aug-2008:
  - zip archive can be any kind of stream (not only a file), for both 
      extraction (unzip) and creation (zip)

* Changes in '25', 1-May-2008:
  - some improvements in the demo-tools, no change in the library

* Changes in '24', 27-Mar-2008:
  - Added case-sensitivity to UnZip.Streams.Open(...)
  - tl parameter is 'out' from 'in out'
  - UnZip.Decompress: hinted compressed size limited to Type'Last-2
      to avoid modular type wraparound
  - Replaced loop in UnZip.Streams.Read by slice copies
  - UnZip.Streams.Read doesn't raise End_Error anymore (it's T'Read's job)
     -> Read is conform to the Ada 2005 standard RM 13.13.1/.2
  - Zip: exception with message

* Changes in '23', 11-Jan-2008:
  - Added a new tool, ReZip: recompression using several zippers
  - Cleanup; buffer-reading up to an eventual end-of-file is simplified,
      now in a new Zip.ReadBlock

* Changes in '22', 14-Dec-2007:
  - Added a new Compose_File_Name to UnZip.File_System_Routines
      see new "-d dir" option in the UnZipAda tool
  - Added Zip.Compress, Zip.Compress.Shrink
      see the ZipAda tool, which has now the light "Shrink" compression

* Changes in '21', 12-Sep-2007:
  - New license: MIT License (more explicit rights, recognized)
  - Password permanent over multiple files (bug appeared in v. 20)

* Changes in '20', 16-Mar-2007:
  - UnZ_Glob, UnZ_IO, UnZ_Olds, UnZ_Infl now sub-packages of procedure
      UnZip.Decompress.Decompress_data (UnZip.Decompress is a private
      child package of UnZip);
      no more global variables, then UnZip-Ada is now task-safe.
  - UnZ_Huft becomes UnZip.Decompress.Huffman
  - Zip_info dictionary tree is now balanced: optimally fast access to
      entries, much faster loading too

* Changes in '19', 9-Mar-2007:
  - New Zip library with Zip stuff concerning not only decompression;
      packages: Zip, Zip.Headers, Zip.CRC

* Changes in '18', 2-Mar-2007:
  - Zip_Headers package replaces of UnZ_Head; this packages not only copies
    various headers from buffers but also directly manages streamed inputs
    and outputs - it can be then also used for writing Zip archives
  - Improved support for 1-pass written archives, without compression
    - needs a hint about "compressed" size! E.g. OpenDocument .ODS

* Changes in '17', 8-Dec-2006:
  - Long file names in sources
  - Cleanup with GNAT GPL 2006 and AdaControl 1.6r8

* Changes in '16', 22-Apr-2006:
  - All I/O via Streams_IO; doesn't help the speed on GNAT and ObjectAda
    but lets room for it, since whole blocks are read and written

* Changes in '15', 28-Sep-2005:
  - Compatible with 1-pass written archives (e.g. JAR):
    fixed parts with data descriptors
  - "Out" parameter flaw not detected by GNAT or Aonix
  - Cleanup with GNAT GPL 2005 and AdaControl 

* Changes in '14', 8-Jul-2003:
  - Cleanup. Looks more like Ada code...

* Changes in '13', 22-Jun-2003:
  -  Fixed workaround for an incomplete d-tree ("Bug" in PKZIP 1.93a &
     a 2001 version of KZIP). Test with "incdtree.zip".

* Changes in '12', 13-Dec-2002:
  -   Fixed decryption for 'stored' mode.

* Changes in '11', 29-Nov-2002:
  -   New generic procedure for traversing a Zip directory structure
      As demo, a tool (comp_zip) for comparing two .Zip files, useful
      when combining zip, pkzip, 7zip, kzip and zipmix to shrink archives
      and check them after.

* Changes in '10':
  - improvements around zip_info

* Changes in '09':
  - appended zipfiles (e.g. self-extracting archives) work for "extract_all"
  - tolerance for '/' & '\' in directory names
  - faster recognition of a non-.zip archive
  - procedure Extract_all_files renamed Extract (coherent with
    the other Extract's)
  - test_only option completed with the following:
    - case_sensitive_match : match file names case sensitively; could be
      useful for some operating systems designed before 1980
    - option junk_directories (ignore dir. info : extract to current one)
  - decryption

* Changes in '08':
  - exceptions declarations moved from Unz_Glob to the more public Unzip

* Changes in '07':
  - generic dropped for abandoned implode method (no need for speed)
    -> smaller code
  - UnZ_Olds glues all non-inflate decompressions

* New in `06':
  - Streams implemented (Package Unzip.Streams) !
    see procedure test_unz_streams (teunzstr.adb) for a small example

* New in `05' (1-Dec-1999):
  - changed long_long_integer to long_integer (-> purer Ada 95);
  - demo (unzipada.adb) doesn't use the GNAT-specific `unrestricted_access'
    attribute (-> purer Ada 95);
  - now tested successfully on GNAT/DOS, GNAT/NT, GNAT/Linux, ObjectAda

Thanks to...
============

The ITEC team (NXP Semiconductors), for extending the medium for
   zip archives from file only to streams of any sort (v.26)

Jérôme Haguet, CADWIN, for nice discussions and contributions
   (UnZip.File_System_Routines.Compose_File_Name)

Arnaud Lefebvre, CADWIN

Tucker Taft (himself!), SofCheck, for providing fixes (v.24) and
   an impressive targets in-use list

Pascal Pignard, for testing the UnZipAda.adb tool under Mac OS X

To do
=====
  - a serious profiling/optimization exercise, sorting out the
      external I/O part; see prof_uza.bat
  - store file attributes in Zip_info
  - streaming decoding in UnZip.Streams

To do further
=============
  - ZipAda with a strong compression
  - Make a public access to UnZip.Decompress, as a zlib proxy

To do even further, beyond the .zip area
========================================
  - translate the free UnRAR source
  - make a compressor / decompressor with recent techniques (e.g. PAQ)
