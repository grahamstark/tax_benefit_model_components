Microsimulation Model Components
============================

This is a moderately large collection of code used to build microsimulation models, mostly in the Ada language.

It includes:
            
* Several specialist tabulators
* An implementation of a Piecewise Linear Budget Constraint generator (see: http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/2063)
* Interfaces to various large scale sample survey datasets;
* Utilities for building web interfaces in Ada;
* Affordability Indexes;
* Inequality Measures;
* Data Re-Weighting routines
* Tax Calculators; and 
* Optimisation Routines.
            
There is also an experimental complete South African tax benefit
model, and some, but not all, of the code required for a UK Tax
Benefit model.

We've taken the liberty of bundling four useful libraries with this code.
